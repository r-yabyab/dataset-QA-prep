Start

Create template: {"Question": "", "Answer": ""}
    - Append Answer when chunking, less than half the max_seq_length
    - check for null, check for EOS within Answer



play around with the token size for A. 400 is kinda big, liek a couple of methods 
- to check how much data is just "{"
- Map files that are done
- Separate API docs


Use cosine_similarity to find Answers that are similar, like default Index.jsx, to remove duplicates

Logging?

How to keep downstream context?

https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT
- decoders for cosine_similarity
- graphcodebert
==> these need to be finetuned to work
    - https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT/tree/master/UniXcoder#2-similarity-between-code-and-nl
    - use UniXcoder, pretrained on codebases, no NL


No empty files
No dupes (based on semantics)
No nulls in API docs, txt, anything non code

- for synthdatagen

mention language in q?
