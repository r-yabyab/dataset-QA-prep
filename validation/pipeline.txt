Dev:
Goal: generate code at inference based on my github repositories
Problem: Different programming languages, static parsing

1. Split each file into less than 500 tokens (llama-7b) into A in Q by:
    a. Lang separators through LangChain (code snippets, not validated)
    b. AST
        requires separate parsers for each language
2. Filter
    a. Small answers 
    b. Sensitive material
    c. Dupes (through code embedding then cosine_sim)
3. Generate synthetic Qs
    a. Based on Answer alone
    b. Based on Answer + RAG context (pass Answer, no LLM if possible?) to maintain context
4. Template to LLM
5. Split into train and eval datasets
    - default params on full v. half size dataset, then change params
    - use logger (wandb)
